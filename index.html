        <h1>Welcome to Fidgetland Minigames and More</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Hello, I am Fidgetboyrolly, and I am the owner of Fidgetland Minigames and More. If you want to join Fidgetland, contact me, and I will do my best to help you. If you have Discord, then you can DM me at @fidgetboyrolly or go to the Fidgetland Discord server.</p>
        <p>If you want to know what Fidgetland is, then I can tell you. Fidgetland is my Minecraft server. I once was talking to someone about how I wanted to make my own website and sell mods and world downloads for some extra cash when they said I should make it free for everyone, and so I decided to start Fidgetland, a minigame-filled server of fun. You play games like Fidget Escape, earn minigame gems, and buy cosmetics. It is available in both Java and Bedrock editions.</p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Fidgetland is a minigame server and is simple to play:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You play minigames to earn minigame emeralds.</li>
            <li>You buy awesome cosmetics from the Fidgetland store.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>(P.S. I am still working on Fidgetland, so you may have to wait to play it. Sorry!)</p>
